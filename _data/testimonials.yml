  - quote: 'I am a retired public school teacher. Though I own my home, I know practically nothing about the Real Estate business. I first met Durwin Cheung in the elevator of our building over 6 years ago. He struck me as well-mannered refined young man. Throughout the years. I discovered his other good qualities: a man with integrity, sincerity, generosity, thoughtfulness and humility etc. On one occasion, he assisted me in selling my "Piano Library" with other music book collections, and asked for nothing in return. I have recommended him to several friends who were interested in purchasing properties. They were all extremely impressed with his patience, honestly, dedication and professionalism. As my friend Judy once said, "When you talk to Durwin, he really listens.'

  - quote: 'Durwin is the best real estate agent I have ever worked with. I have bought and sold many properties in San Francisco, and have found Durwin to always be exceptional in his skill and knowledge as a realtor. He is the ultimate professional - smart, courteous, prompt, reliable and always willing to go the extra mile for his clients. He always has your best interests in mind, not his, which is rare in the real estate world.'

  - quote: 'Durwin was very helpful and informative about the availability of homes we were looking at in our price range. He ended up finding us our current home through a private sale. This displayed his diligence as an agent in finding us the desired home through alternative means besides public listings.'
