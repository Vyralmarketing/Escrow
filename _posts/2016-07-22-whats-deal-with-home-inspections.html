Bruce has been in the business with House Master for 24 years, and they've done 79,000 inspections. <br /><br />According to Bruce, <b>the two most common inspections that homeowners should be aware of are termite inspections and home inspections,</b> which have some similarities and differences. Both will point out things like earth-wood contact, wood damage, moisture content, and ventilation issues, but differ in that the home inspector can't do any work on the home or solicit business on it. The termite inspector is supposed to create estimates in the report. <br /><br /><div style="border: solid 1px #c9c9c9; display: block; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px 10px; width: 80%;"><span style="color: #1faabd; display: block; float: left; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 100px; line-height: 50px; position: absolute;">“</span><br /><div style="color: black; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 10px; text-align: center;">The seller should expect that there will be issues from the inspection that will need to be worked out.     </div><br /><span style="color: #1faabd; display: block; float: right; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 100px; line-height: 50px;">”</span></div><br /><b>As a seller, it's important to make the inspection go smoothly by providing access to the crawl space (if the home has one), the attic, and the electrical panel.</b> The seller should also expect that there will be issues from the inspection that will need to be worked out with the buyer. On the buyer side, they should make a point to read the inspection report from front to back - <b>don't rely solely on the verbal comments from the inspector.</b> Buyers should also vet the inspector before choosing one. Home inspectors are only licensed in two-thirds of states so they may or may not be regulated. They should be trained and they should be insured. <br /><br />What I like about House Master is that Bruce comes around the office twice a month, and they're always up on the latest technology with a <a href="https://housemaster.com/" target="_blank">great website</a>. <b>They also provide reports that are really nice, easy to read and understand, and just makes it easier on the consumer.</b> If you have questions or are looking for an inspection, feel free to reach out to either one of us and we'll be in touch!
