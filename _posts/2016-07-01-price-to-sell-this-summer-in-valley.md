If you're thinking about selling your home this summer in The Valley, you want to be sure you're aware of how to price your home to sell. There needs to be a strategy, because **there's a difference between the price you're trying to accomplish and the list price.** Homes have a peak interest level in the first 30 days on the market, so it's important to price correctly from the get-go to capture buzz in the first couple weeks. 

There are three scenarios of pricing a home. 

**Group A:** Priced too high because they think it's worth more, and get less interest and fewer offers. 

**Group B:** Priced right in the middle, and the home doesn't necessarily stand out. Buyers compare your home to other similarly priced homes. 

**Group C:** Homes priced a little less than what we expect to get. We feel this strategy works the best. If we price slightly less, it shows well, you have good marketing, and you have a great agent on your side, so you're creating the perfect recipe for a bidding war.

You'll get more people coming through, and more offers, which drives the price up. There are more details that come into play of course. If you have questions, please feel free to reach out to us.
