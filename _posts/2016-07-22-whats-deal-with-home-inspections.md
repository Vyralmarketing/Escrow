Today I'm joined by Bruce Howe from [House Master](https://housemaster.com/), 
who we've been working with for a number of years, to talk about inspections. 
Bruce has been in the business with House Master for 24 years, and they've 
done 79,000 inspections. 

According to Bruce, **the two most common inspections that homeowners should 
be aware of are termite inspections and home inspections,** which have some 
similarities and differences. Both will point out things like earth-wood 
contact, wood damage, moisture content, and ventilation issues, but differ in 
that the home inspector can't do any work on the home or solicit business on 
it. The termite inspector is supposed to create estimates in the report.

<div style="color: black; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 auto; 
padding: 0 10px; text-align: center;">The seller should expect that there will 
be issues from the inspection that will need to be worked out.

## As a seller, it's important to make the inspection go smoothly by providing 
access to the crawl space (if the home has one), the attic, and the electrical 
panel. The seller should also expect that there will be issues from the 
inspection that will need to be worked out with the buyer. On the buyer side, 
they should make a point to read the inspection report from front to back - 
**don't rely solely on the verbal comments from the inspector.** Buyers should 
also vet the inspector before choosing one. Home inspectors are only licensed 
in two-thirds of states so they may or may not be regulated. They should be 
trained and they should be insured. 

What I like about House Master is that Bruce comes around the office twice a 
month, and they're always up on the latest technology with a [great 
website](https://housemaster.com/). **They also provide reports that are 
really nice, easy to read and understand, and just makes it easier on the 
consumer.** If you have questions or are looking for an inspection, feel free 
to reach out to either one of us and we'll be in touch!
