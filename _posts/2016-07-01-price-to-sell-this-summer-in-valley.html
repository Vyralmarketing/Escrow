There needs to be a strategy, because <b>there's a difference between the price you're trying to accomplish and the list price.</b> Homes have a peak interest level in the first 30 days on the market, so it's important to price correctly from the get-go to capture buzz in the first couple weeks.<br /><br />There are three scenarios of pricing a home.<br /><br /><b>Group A:</b> Priced too high because they think it's worth more, and get less interest and fewer offers. <br /><br /><b>Group B:</b> Priced right in the middle, and the home doesn't necessarily stand out. Buyers compare your home to other similarly priced homes.<br /><br /><b>Group C: </b>Homes priced a little less than what we expect to get. We feel this strategy works the best. If we price slightly less, it shows well, you have good marketing, and you have a great agent on your side, so you're creating the perfect recipe for a bidding war.<br /><br /><div style="border: solid 1px #c9c9c9; display: block; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px 10px; width: 80%;"><span style="color: #1faabd; display: block; float: left; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 100px; line-height: 50px; position: absolute;">“</span><br /><div style="color: black; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 10px; text-align: center;">Homes have peak interest level in the first 30 days.     </div><br /><span style="color: #1faabd; display: block; float: right; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 100px; line-height: 50px;">”</span></div><br />You'll get more people coming through, and more offers, which drives the price up.
