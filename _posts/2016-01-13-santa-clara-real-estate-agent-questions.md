When it comes time for you to hire a real estate agent, you have almost too many options. **Today we are going to discuss the top 5 questions you should be asking any real estate agent before you hire them**, so you can filter through the plethora of agents out there in order to find the right one for you. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">**1. Are you a full-time agent? 
** 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">There are a lot of part-time 
agents out there; unfortunately, they don't have the necessary time or 
experience to provide good service.** Here at PRG Real Estate, we are all 
full-time agents, **and we are always working our hardest to give you the best 
service possible. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><b> 
</b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">**2. What kind of operation do 
you run?** 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">A lot of agents attempt to do 
everything themselves. **This is not an efficient process,** which is why many 
solo agents aren't able to give their clients the service they deserve. We 
have a team of specialized individuals that is designed to make your 
transaction one smooth process. Our support staff is in place to free up time 
for our agents so they can spend that time helping you buy or sell a home. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">**3. Do you have client 
testimonials?** 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">We survey all of our clients 
each year and ask their honest opinions about working with us. We appreciate 
all the feedback that we get, positive or negative, and use it to improve our 
business. **Any agent you hire should be doing the same.** 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><b> 
</b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">**4. Do you have a marketing 
plan?** 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Marketing listings is crucial in 
our market, and we know that. **That's why we have our own personalized 
marketing plan **which details our proven strategies and cutting edge 
marketing techniques that will net top dollar for your home. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><b> 
</b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">**5. What percentage of your 
business comes from referrals?** 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">A good agent should have happy 
customers that want to come back and do business again, or refer their friends 
and family members. About 30-40% of our business comes from referrals and 
previous clients, and we take great pride in that.
