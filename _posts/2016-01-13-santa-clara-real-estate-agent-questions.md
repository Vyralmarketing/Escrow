When it comes time for you to hire a real estate agent, you have almost too many options. **Today we are going to discuss the top 5 questions you should be asking any real estate agent before you hire them**, so you can filter through the plethora of agents out there in order to find the right one for you. 

**1. Are you a full-time agent?** There are a lot of part-time agents out there; unfortunately, they don't have the necessary time or experience to provide good service.** Here at PRG Real Estate, we are all full-time agents, **and we are always working our hardest to give you the best service possible. 

**2. What kind of operation do you run?** A lot of agents attempt to do everything themselves. **This is not an efficient process,** which is why many solo agents aren't able to give their clients the service they deserve. We have a team of specialized individuals that is designed to make your transaction one smooth process. Our support staff is in place to free up time for our agents so they can spend that time helping you buy or sell a home. 
**3. Do you have client testimonials?** We survey all of our clients each year and ask their honest opinions about working with us. We appreciate all the feedback that we get, positive or negative, and use it to improve our business. **Any agent you hire should be doing the same.**

**4. Do you have a marketing plan?** Marketing listings is crucial in our market, and we know that. **That's why we have our own personalized marketing plan **which details our proven strategies and cutting edge marketing techniques that will net top dollar for your home. 

**5. What percentage of your business comes from referrals?** A good agent should have happy customers that want to come back and do business again, or refer their friends and family members. About 30-40% of our business comes from referrals and previous clients, and we take great pride in that.
