<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , 
&quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">We’ve been getting the question “Is 
Zillow an accurate place to find my home’s value?” a lot, and today we are 
going to explain how it works and what it is useful for. 

Here’s what Zillow is good for. Number one, it’s probably the most widely-used 
commercially marketed real estate search engine. **Studies have shown that 
70-75% of buyers visit the site.** Zillow also offers an automated home value 
feature that they call a Zestimate. Zestimates are good jumping off points, 
but they’re just estimates. 

## Zestimates do not take into account your property’s condition, or all the 
recent sales in your area. The algorithm can’t determine any updates or 
renovations you have done, and oftentimes <span style="font-family: 
&quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">it <span 
style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;">uses sold data that’s over a year old. 

When a professional agent like one of us comes to your home, we are going to 
take notice of every detail, and assess your home on the current market using 
the latest sold data and up-to-date information. **This will give us the best 
indication of where to price your home to sell for top dollar.**

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;">These are all things that should be taken into account when 
trying to pinpoint your value. Zillow is a great starting point, but if you’re 
looking to make a certain amount of money on your sale, you definitely want to 
contact a professional. If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach 
out to us via phone or email. We are always here to help.** **
