**Today, we’ll be discussing four valuable tips for first-time home buyers** in the surrounding Silicon Valley area. Blanca Medellin, a real estate buying agent on our team, joins us to discuss important advice for first-time home buyers. If you’re looking to purchase a home this spring, this is especially relevant to you! 

**1. Save up for your down payment.** In today’s conditions, most lenders require anywhere from 3% to 30% in a down payment. Be prepared to pay more than you initially anticipate.

**2. Consider any home improvement or other expenses.** The total cost is not only your mortgage payment, but utility, landscaping, maintenance, and other monthly bills.

**3. Shop around for a mortgage.** Find someone you’re comfortable with. Review your finances and share your goals to obtain a prequalification letter.

**4. Get educated on the home buying process.** Sit down with us for a one-on-one consultation, free of charge and obligation. We’ll walk you through every step and what you should expect.
