We're onto the second quarter in the Santa Clara County real estate market, so I wanted to give you a quick update. 

When we last checked on the market, inventory was just over 1,000 homes, average price was around $860,000, average days on market sat about 69, and the interest rates were sitting around 3.75%. So what's happened since then? Well, we're entering **a presidential election, and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates.** People thought this would increase mortgage interest rates, but they actually came down a little bit. 

<a href="https://twitter.com/home/?status={{page.pullquote}}%20{{site.url}}{{page.url}}%20via%40{{site.data.settings.socials.twitter | remove: 'https://twitter.com/'}}" target='_blank' class="pullquote">&#8220;{{page.pullquote}}&#8221;</a>

Starting in the second quarter, homes on the market have gone up by 700, price is up to $931,000, and the average days on market has fallen to 41, and of course, interest rates are down around the 3.625% range for 30-year fixed mortgages. **This means we're still in a seller's market, but there is some more inventory.** In some areas, we're starting to see homes get fewer offers, but it's still very competitive and sellers are still getting top dollar quickly. 

If you're looking to sell, it's still a good time, and if you're looking to buy, there's more inventory for you. **Don't give up hope!** You just need to partner with the right agent. 

Thanks again for your support. If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch and we'll talk soon.
