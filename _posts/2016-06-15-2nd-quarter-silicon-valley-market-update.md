We're onto the second quarter in the Santa Clara County real estate market, so 
I wanted to give you a quick update. 

When we last checked on the market, inventory was just over 1,000 homes, 
average price was around $860,000, average days on market sat about 69, and 
the interest rates were sitting around 3.75%. So what's happened since then? 
Well, we're entering** a presidential election, and the Federal Reserve 
increased interest rates.** People thought this would increase mortgage 
interest rates, but they actually came down a little bit. 

Starting in the second quarter, homes on the market have gone up by 700, price 
is up to $931,000, and the average days on market has fallen to 41, and of 
course, interest rates are down around the 3.625% range for 30-year fixed 
mortgages. **This means we're still in a seller's market, but there is some 
more inventory. **In some areas, we're starting to see homes get fewer offers, 
but it's still very competitive and sellers are still getting top dollar 
quickly. 

<div style="border: solid 1px #c9c9c9; display: block; margin: 0 auto; 
padding: 20px 10px; width: 80%;"><span style="color: #1faabd; display: block;

<div style="color: black; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 auto; 
padding: 0 10px; text-align: center;">Don't give up hope! 
<span style="color: #1faabd; display: block; float: right; font-family: 
&quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 100px; line-height: 50px;">” 
If you're looking to sell, it's still a good time, and if you're looking to 
buy, there's more inventory for you. **Don't give up hope!** You just need to 
partner with the right agent.
