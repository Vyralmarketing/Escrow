<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , 
&quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you plan on selling your current house 
and buying a new one, there are a few things you need to take into 
consideration. 

The first question to ask is **whether you need the equity from your current 
property in order to purchase a new property.** If the answer is yes, we 
suggest you list the property you’re living in first, in order to have the 
purchasing power necessary to buy your next home. 

If you have the cash in the bank to buy your next home without having to sell, 
it’s a great position to be in. In that case, you can go ahead and start 
looking at properties before you even list. However, **you should be aware of 
the possibility that you might have two mortgages at the same time.** 

Regardless of what you end up doing, **it’s crucial to be aware of market 
conditions. **Here in Silicon Valley, it’s a very competitive market<span 
style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">; 
there is a lot of inventory and there are a lot of buyers. In this situation, 
**putting an offer on a home that is contingent on you selling your current 
home is not going to make you look as powerful** as someone else who has 
already sold their home and has some money in the bank.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , 
sans-serif;">In this market, sellers need to be aware of something called 
rent-backs. Basically, **a rent-back is a situation in which the seller asks 
the buyer to rent back the property** from the new buyers. This agreement 
extends the closing so that sellers can remain in their house, while paying 
rent to the buyer, as they finalize their new living situation. Many sellers 
have found this to be a great way to purchase a new home without having to 
move more than once. 

If you have questions about how you can make your move as smooth as possible, 
or if you have any questions about our local market, please don’t hesitate to 
reach out to us. We would love to give you a hand!  <b>
